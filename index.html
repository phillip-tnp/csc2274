<h1>Phillip Simon</h1>
  
<p>
Phillip has always been a photographer. He fulfilled his childhood fantasy of using fancy cameras when he got his first 35 mm film camera at the age of 13. As a printmaking major at the University of the Arts, Phill learned and practiced the art of graphic arts, combining drawing and photography with traditional printmaking techniques. In 1980, during graduate school at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, he began experimenting with multi-image techniques to marry image and sound to express ideas.

In the early 80s, Phillip created sound designs for dance and theater performances. He also expanded his media skills as a freelance video producer. In the early nineties, he collaborated with Joy Wulke contributing projections and sound design for an installation in Connecticut and an installation in Los Angeles. In the mid-eighties, he worked producing computer graphics for presentations and video productions. It was at this time, in 1987, that Phillipâ€™s tenure at Yale University started, where he was hired to establish a video production unit. His work doing video led to the creation of video disks for multimedia productions, and subsequently to the management of educational software production.
